# PesudoChat

## About

**PesudoChat** is an application that mimics the functionality of a ChatBot. The objective of this project was to practice DOM manipulation using jQuery.

Upon loading the chat window, you can send PsuedoChat a message and see it posted to the chat field. After a default response, PsuedoChat will give a series of randomized responses. User can send 'clear' to reset the chat. PseudoChat's responses are simple, as the objective of this project was to practice DOM manipulation and slick CSS.
